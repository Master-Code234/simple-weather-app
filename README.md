Approach taken: 

In this project I developed a weather app using React JS that provides users with current weather information. My approach to creating this project was to first plan out my website by creating a blueprint of how I wanted the final UI and site to look. I did this using the draw.io website.Creating a blueprint helped me to visualize the basic structure that I wanted and what the site might look like when it's finished. Then I broke my website down into 3 components: searchBar, weather-info and weatherBar. Each one of the components has a specific task. In order to make my code more manageable I decided to create separate css files for each component.
