Approach taken: 

In this project I have created a weather app in react js that displays basic weather info to the user. 
My approach to creating this project was to first create a blueprint of how I wanted the final UI and site to look.
Then I broke the UI down into 3 separate components. I decided to create a separate stylesheet for each of my components to improve
code organization and readability.




Technologies Used:

.  React JS

.  VsCode

.  CSS FlexBox

.  OpenWeatherMap API
